## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify wines into one of three classes: 1, 2, or 3 (Bad,Average,Good). This classification is based on various features and attributes of the wine samples, making it a multi-class classification problem.

The repository provides the necessary code and resources to train, evaluate, and use this model for wine classification.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `DS` directory. It contains features such as the chemical composition of wines, and the target variable indicating the wine class. You can find the dataset in CSV format.
